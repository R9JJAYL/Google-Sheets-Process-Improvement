# Google-Sheets-Process-Improvement

This was a project focused on process improvement across 3 Google Sheets, during my employment at hackajob

* Senior Leads saved 45+ minutes a week on admin
* All KPI scores improved considerably (especially the main kpis increased by 15+%) 
* Encouraged for professional development focused in weaker areas, and allowed colleagues who were stronger in those areas gain exposure to training 
* The team gained a deeper understanding of how their KPIs were being calculated
* Made considerable improvements to the design of how the information is entered and presented 
* Friendly and fun competition was introduced between the teams
* Supported people, analyzing their performance when it came round to annual reviews 
* Over 2 years later, these sheets and processes are still in place, even 1 year after me leaving (I left in 2023, sheets were made in 2021)

The main skills used in this project were, process automation, stakeholder management, performance analysis, UI design practices, conditional formatting, mathematical calculations, general Sheets functions and ‘safety precautions’ such as sheet protection and ‘if errors’.
